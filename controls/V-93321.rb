    Application mitigations defined in the STIG are configured by a DoD EP XML file included with the STIG package in the \"Supporting Files\" folder.

    The XML file is applied with the group policy setting Computer Configuration >> Administrative Settings >> Windows Components >> Windows Defender Exploit Guard >> Exploit Protection >> \"Use a common set of exploit protection settings\" configured to \"Enabled\" with file name and location defined under \"Options:\".  It is recommended the file be in a read-only network location."
